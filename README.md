## BMI Calculator ⚖️

<img src="assets/images/bmi-calculator.png" width="300">



The **BMI Calculator** is a fundamental tool on the **Ivan’s Fitness** platform, helping users assess their **body composition** and determine their **fitness category**. By entering **height and weight**, users receive an instant **Body Mass Index (BMI) score**, which categorizes them into one of several groups:



✅ **Underweight** – Focus on **muscle gain** and **nutrient-rich diet**.  

✅ **Normal Weight** – Maintain a **balanced** exercise routine.  

✅ **Overweight** – Implement **fat-burning** workouts and **healthy eating habits**.  

✅ **Obese** – Prioritize **low-impact exercises** and **gradual weight loss strategies**.  



The calculator is **simple and user-friendly**, requiring only two inputs: **weight (kg)** and **height (cm)**. After pressing the **Calculate** button, the system processes the data and provides a **clear BMI result** along with a **category description**. This **guides users** toward an **effective and personalized workout plan**.



### 💡 Interactive Workout Highlighting

✔️ The system **highlights** the **most suitable workout plan** for the user.  

✔️ The **corresponding exercise category turns yellow**, providing a **clear visual cue**.  

✔️ Users can easily **navigate** to their **personalized fitness plan** without confusion.  



📌 **Regular use of the BMI Calculator** helps users **track progress** as their **weight and body composition** change over time.
