  <h1>Welcome to Ivan's Fitness</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Your Fitness Plan!</p>
  <p>Here, I aim to help you achieve the best possible results based on your body mass index (BMI). Using the BMI calculator, we will select the most suitable workout plans for you. The plans are divided into five categories, each tailored to different BMI results:</p>
  <ul style="text-align: left; padding-left: 20px;">
    <li><strong>Underweight:</strong> If your BMI indicates that you're underweight, we’ll focus on strength-building exercises to help you gain muscle mass.</li>
    <li><strong>Normal weight:</strong> For those in the healthy BMI range, we’ll focus on a balanced workout plan that includes a mix of strength training and cardio.</li>
    <li><strong>Overweight:</strong> If you fall into the overweight category, we’ll prioritize exercises that help burn fat, improve cardiovascular health, and promote lean muscle development.</li>
    <li><strong>Obese:</strong> For individuals in this category, the goal is to start with low-impact exercises and focus on gradual weight loss while improving overall health.</li>
    <li><strong>Muscle Building:</strong> For those aiming to build muscle mass, we’ll provide a more intense workout plan with heavy lifting and targeted exercises.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each category will have exercises and plans designed specifically to meet your goals.</p>

  <h2>Get Inspired – Take the First Step</h2>
  <div class="inspiration-content">
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Ivan! Born in the Czech Republic, I have been living in the UK for over eight years. 
      Fitness is my passion, and recently, I have discovered a new enthusiasm for programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      My fitness journey started six years ago, and I understand how challenging it can be in the beginning. 
      But trust me—over time, you will see your body transform, and you will feel stronger and more confident 
      in your "new body." I’ve restarted my journey multiple times because the biggest challenge is not the 
      weights but yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I am not a medical professional, I can guide you in selecting the best workouts and 
      recommend high-quality fitness products such as protein supplements, pre-workouts, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal with this website is to inspire you to take the first step toward a healthier, stronger you. 
      I have created simple, easy-to-follow workout categories to help you get started. If you're interested, 
      I can also design a personalized workout plan tailored to your goals. 
      Feel free to reach out via the contact form or email.
